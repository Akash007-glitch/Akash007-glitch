👋 Hi, I’m Akash

I’m a frontend-focused web developer who builds modern, fast, and user-driven web applications using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I don’t waste time on theory — I learn by building real products like travel platforms, dashboards, and interactive UIs that people can actually use.

Right now I’m focused on:

Creating clean, responsive, conversion-optimized interfaces

Turning designs into high-performance web apps

Integrating Firebase, APIs, and real-time features

I believe in shipping, improving, and iterating — not waiting to be “ready.”
If you like practical development and real-world projects, you’ll fit right in here.
